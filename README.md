## 3-tier architecture
A 3-tier architecture is a software architecture pattern that divides an application into three interconnected layers: presentation layer (also known as the user interface or client layer), business logic layer (also known as the application or service layer), and data storage layer (also known as the data layer). This modular approach separates the concerns of presentation, logic, and data management, making the system more scalable, maintainable, and flexible. The presentation layer handles user interaction and displays information to users, the business logic layer processes data and implements application logic, and the data storage layer manages data persistence and retrieval.
